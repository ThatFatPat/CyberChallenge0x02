The Goal:
1) The following program receives a secret key. 
2) Write a crack for the program that computes the secret key ( you can use any coding
language you prefer: python. Rust. c/c++, java, ...)
Patching the program to accept Any Key won’t be accepted as a solution!
Instructions:
1) Run on linux 64bit machine (Debian/Ubuntu).
2) IDA may come in handy here (So, read an introduction tutorial to get started).
3) The program is “heavy” so it will take a few seconds to compute the key.
The best thing is to wait a few seconds between executions.
Bonus Question:
Why does it take some time in order to compute the key when running the program over and over?
Write the full reason for this behaviour.
